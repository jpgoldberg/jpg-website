This is the Post I was thinking about when I decided to create a collage of Posts for my posts page.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Leon_Post)

> Emil Leon Post ( February 11, 1897 – April 21, 1954)
> was an American mathematician and logician.
> He is best known for his work in the field that eventually became known as computability theory.

In his 1921 doctoral thesis

> Post proved, among other things,
> that the propositional calculus of _Principia Mathematica_ was complete:
> all tautologies are theorems,
> given the Principia axioms and the rules of substitution and modus ponens.
> [...]
> In 1936, Post developed, independently of Alan Turing,
> a mathematical model of computation that was essentially equivalent to the Turing machine model.

The Post correspondence problem and its undecidability is exactly why we should not be using the full power of Turing machines when parsing potentially malicious input.
This idea is the central driver of language theoretic security,
but that is a discussion for another time.

### Emily Post {#emily}

Although I am not known for my good taste or social etiquette,
Emily Post is the other Post (beyond Emil) that I was aware of
before I started collecting Posts.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Post)

> Emily Post (née Price; c. October 27, 1872 – September 25, 1960)
> was an American author, novelist, and socialite famous for writing about etiquette.
> [...]
> Post began to write once her two sons were old enough to attend boarding school.
> Her early work included humorous travel books,
> newspaper articles on architecture and interior design,
> and magazine serials for _Harper's_, _Scribner's_, and _The Century_.

What she is most remembered for is her guidance on etiqutte.

> Post wrote her first etiquette book
> _Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics, and at Home_
> (1922, frequently referenced as Etiquette) when she was 50.
> It became a best-seller with numerous editions over the following decades.
> After 1931, Post spoke on radio programs and wrote a column on good taste
> for the Bell Syndicate. The column appeared daily in over 200 newspapers after 1932

### Frans Post {#frans}

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_Post)

> Frans Janszoon Post (17 November 1612 – 17 February 1680)
> was a painter during the Dutch Golden Age.
> He was the first European artist to paint landscapes of the Americas,
> during and after the period of Dutch Brazil.
> In 1636 he traveled to Dutch Brazil in northeast of South America
> at the invitation of the governor Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen.

His landscapes really look like Dutch landscapes to me.
Even with tropical vegetation, they just feel like Baroque Dutch landscapes.


### Louis F. Post {#louis}

{{< figure

  height=60px
  class="floatright"

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_F._Post)

> Louis Freeland Post (November 15, 1849 – January 11, 1928)
> was a prominent [Georgist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism)
> and the Assistant United States Secretary of Labor
> during the closing year of the Wilson administration,
> the period of the [Palmer Raids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Raids)
> and the First Red Scare,
> where he had responsibility for the Bureau of Immigration.
> Post considered the process to be a witch hunt
> and is credited with preventing many deportations and freeing many innocent people.

### Marion Post Wolcott {#marion}

> Marion Post Wolcott (June 7, 1910 – November 24, 1990)
> was an American photographer who worked for the Farm Security Administration
> during the Great Depression,
> documenting poverty, the [Jim Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow) South,
> and deprivation.

And the Wikipedia article goes on to say that she was from places very close to
[my home town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Caldwell,_New_Jersey "West Caldwell, New Jersey").

> Marion Post was born in [Montclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montclair,_New_Jersey),
> New Jersey [...]
> to Marion (née Hoyt; known as "Nan") and Walter Post, a physician.
> She grew up in the family home in
> [Bloomfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomfield,_New_Jersey),

In a [2022 article](https://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/news/capturing-us-history-and-humanity-photographs-marion-post-wolcott "Capturing U.S. History and Humanity"),
Carey Moncaster, Marion's grandchild, quotes from
Marion's 1990 address at a Women in Photography conference:

> Women have come a long way, but not far enough.
> Ahead still are formidable hurdles.
> Speak with your images from your heart and soul.
> Give of yourself. Trust your gut reactions.
> Suck out the juices—the essence of your life experiences.
> Get on with it; it may not be too late.
