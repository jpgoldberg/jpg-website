Google's introduction of the `otpauth` URI scheme made it easy 
for people and organization to deploy
and for individuals to enroll in
{{<abbr TOTP "Time-based One Time Password">}} authentication.
However, the initial implementations and description of the scheme left a number of ambiguities in and inconsistences in place.

This 2019 PasswordsCon talk discussed those ambiguities and contradictions along with some of the consequences I had observed.
I agrue that in general we need more well-constructed standards and complience with those standards, even though I don't offer a clear path for fixed TOTP.

## Context for these slides

This talk was presented when I worked for 1Password.
I have updated contact information in the slides and switched to typefaces which have freer licenses.

PasswordCon has a tradition of including pictures of cats on slides that present background that most audience members are already familiar with.
I had also been challenged to include something from my visit to the [Vasa Museum](https://www.vasamuseet.se/en).
