During my time at [1Password](https://1password.com) I led a book club that served as internal security team training.
1Password Inc has granted me rights to publish some of that material.
Most of the material is in the form of slides covering points I wished to make as we worked through _[Serious Cryptography](https://nostarch.com/seriouscrypto)_.

The material is currently available at [jpgoldberg.github.io/sec-training](https://jpgoldberg.github.io/sec-training/)
