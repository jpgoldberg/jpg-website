abstract: "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is widely recommended as a measure to
  improve security. Yet the security that it provides varies dramatically from system
  to system. Misunderstandings of the security properties offered by any particular
  MFA system may lead people to engage in dangerous behavior that they otherwise wouldn't
  engage in.  We have observed that some users believe MFA makes it safe for them
  to handle secrets on a compromised computer as long as some other authentication
  factor remains uncompromised. Another is that the use of MFA may lead people to
  use weaker encryption passwords,  thereby strengthening a less crucial part of their
  security (authentication), while weakening a far more important component.  The
  benefits of offering MFA must be weighed against the potential security damage that
  may result from behaviors that MFA usage might encourage. Either MFA security properties
  need to be communicated effectively to users or its actual security properties need
  to be brought into line with users' expectations. "
